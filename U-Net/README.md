U-Net
===========

U-Net technology
-------
U-Net is one of the earliest semantics segmentation algorithms using full convolution network. The symmetrical U-shaped structure including compressed path and extended path was very innovative at that time, and to some extent affected the design of the following segmentation networks. The name of the network is also taken from its U-shaped shape.
